# Chris Barr Spec-Sheet

These are some bullet points I like to refer back to every now and again to remind myself of the things I'm really good at and/or value when it comes to working with other humans.

## Empathetic

Mentor for those less skilled than myself
* Champion of diversity and inclusion
* In-tune with the struggles of those who use my solutions

## Comprehensive
* Desire to understand the entire system, not just one technical area

## Facilitator
* Engaging and working across teams to achieve executive visions into software with a focus on end user experience; 
* Comfortable in this role as leader or follower as the situation demands

## Adaptable
* Dig in the trenches with new technology or unfamiliar, existing code bases

## Professional
* Strive to do the right thing
* Understanding and pivots when compromises are needed
* Aware of flaws and attempt to be a better Chris than I was yesterday
