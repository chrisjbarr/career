# Auth0

# Backend Engineer

Hello, I'm Chris - thanks for taking some time out of your day to read this cover letter, resume and application.

I've kept my eye on Auth0 open positions for close to a year now, often going back and forth on whether or not I'm qualified to work at well known, highly visible company. 

You see, I've been a developer for close to 20 years now, having started way back in 1998 with Netscape and Internet Explorer - DHTML, XML and `document.all` and `document.layers` and all the other goodie and baddies of that era - to the modern ecosystem of Virtual DOM, package management & versioning, Vue/Angular/React battlegrounds and lately, the CSS in JS wars. Backends and databases too - classic ASP through to Web Forms and MVC and Web API, while sprinkling in some Django along the way.

That's enough buzzwords I suppose, my point is, I'm a generalist developer who is still curious and not afraid of veering ofcourse to learn new things. Due to lack of deep specialization, I often feel too intimidated to apply to roles that I find interesting. Well, that ends today. :) 

In these 20 years I've been mentored and I've been a mentor - and I enjoy being both, often at the same time. I've learned that I require time rolling up the sleeves and being in the trenches of development front-end, back-end or debugging production issues. I've also learned that I require leading by example, providing direction and prioritization, and to communicate across departments, 'the glue' as many refer to it - and owning features from concept to delivery.

It is for these reasons that I feel like I'm a great fit for the "Backend Engineer" role I'm applying for.
