Rajya,

Thank you for the consideration for a role on your team - I am looking forward to next steps.

Overall, I'm left with a favorable impression of the loop. Due to my inexperience with at-scale services and the more traditional technical interview style of live coding data structures and algorithms in 25 minutes - things were quite challenging for me during the third interview. Despite that, I did my best to showcase my thought process while keeping things conversational, and I'm happy with the end result.

I'll admit, I was dismayed when the clock ticked past 6PM EST and I had not received the HR confirmation with Teams meeting link for the AA with Umesh - but my spirits were lifted when he called me directly and asked if I'd like to continue. We wound up having a great conversation and I really enjoyed my time with him.

Chris
