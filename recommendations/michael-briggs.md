# Michael Briggs - Letter of Recommendation for Chris Barr

My name is Michael Briggs.  I am a technology leader and have been managing technology departments for well over 10 years and I wanted to take a moment and tell you about Christopher Barr, who I understand you are considering bringing onto your team.  

I have had the pleasure of working with Christopher on several occasions over the last 10 years.  He is without question the most talented developer I have ever known, and in my role I have literally seen hundreds.  Christopherâ€™s raw technical skills with technologies he knows is unsurpassed and his ability to adapt and learn new ones is nothing short of astonishing.

Christopher is always looking to advance his craft by pursuing new ideas, frameworks, and methodologies as well as engaging his peers with open collaboration.  As you know, finding good technical talent is extremely difficult; your search ended when you found Christopher.

I hope you did not find this recommendation too forward, but rather informative and helpful.

Good luck with your search.
