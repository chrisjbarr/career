# Jesse Squire - Letter of Recommendation for Chris Barr

I'd like to add my voice to those endorsing Chris Barr, who is under consideration for a role on your team.  It isn’t often in this industry that you cross paths with an individual that is truly exceptional, and I consider Chris to be one of them.  I first met Chris in 2008 when he was part of the team interviewing me and worked side-by-side with him for the next year.  Since that time, whenever I find myself looking to build a team, one of my first calls is always to Chris in the hopes that I can entice him to join me.  It has been my fortune that he has done so several times since.  All-in-all, I have worked closely with Chris for roughly five years.

Chris is one of the rare individuals that takes pride in knowing all aspects of his work, from understanding the business and its users to all parts of the technical stack.  Too often, I find that developers are quick to dismiss the need to understand their problem domain and to specialize in a technical area.  "I'm the database guy," I'm a back-end developer," or "I just do the front-end work" are phrases that are commonly used.  Chris, on the other hand, takes a holistic view and is equally adept at understanding the entirety of a system and working across all of its various layers. 

There are two things, in my mind, that distinguish Chris.  The first of those things being that he understands that his job is not to produce code but to provide value to an end-user.  As such, he takes the time to pay attention to detail around business needs and pain points for those using the software that he creates.  He is not just executing someone else's vision, he is helping to drive that vision into directions that produce better user experiences and business value.  This characteristic isn't limited to a single vertical where he has deep knowledge, it is a skill that he applies to any domain that he works in. 

The second differentiator is his tenacity.  Chris is quick to admonish himself for not always knowing the academic labels for things or being able to define the classic algorithm for his approach to a problem.  The truth is that doesn’t matter as he will deliver a quality solution to any problem.  Chris will push himself through whatever walls block his path to deliver the best possible value, whether that involves learning a new vertical, a new technology stack, or spending his nights and weekends researching and prototyping ideas.  He will not stop at meeting the minimum bar, Chris will strive to deliver the best possible solution.  He does this while adapting to the best practices in a given technology and always keeping a pragmatic eye on what is best for delivering value versus what is the most pure technical solution.  Chris’ focus is always on the user.

It is my opinion that he would be an asset for any organization.  Should you wish to speak further about Chris, please don’t hesitate to reach out.  Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I wish you success in you search.
