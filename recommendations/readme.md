# Career / Recommendations

## Overview

I've been fortunate in my career to have worked with many talented and generous mentors, two of which who were kind enough to send unsolicited letters of recommendation to a healthcare based startup (HealthQx) that was considering bringing me on. Lucky for me, their letters convinced the CEO, Mark McAdoo to hire me during a time when financials were tight and outlook was grim. After 12 long months with HealthQx, we were acquired by a Fortune 5 company, where I transitioned into a management role.
