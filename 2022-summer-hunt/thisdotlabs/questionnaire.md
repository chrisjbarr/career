### What interested you about the position?

I've been following Tracy Lee on Twitter for quite some time now, and I've seen her interactions with the community and the relentless promotion of learning with and by This Dot Labs peoples. It's clear she cares about her team and the reputation of the company within the community. The company embraces, both directly and indirectly a "we can't do this without our people" persona. This is what's most interesting to me about the position - being part of a team with the support of leadership to be better.

### What do you do in your current position? What do you like about it? What do you not?

#### Current Position

Presently, I'm a full time remote contractor for American Water ("AW") - a utilities company based out of the Philadelphia, PA area. The contract is on-going with either side requiring a 14 day notice to the other for termination. During my 18 months with AW, I've built strong relationships with business leads, my manager and skip and skip's manager, as well as my direct teammates. I currently split my time between mentoring others, writing stories and coding feature requests as an individual contributor.

My technical day to day consists of working with the following:

- ASP.NET MVC 4.6
- .NET Framework with C# 7
- Vanilla JavaScript (with some jQuery)
- Vanilla CSS
- MSTest, SpecFlow w/Selenium
- ORM is nhibernate over Sql Server
- .NET Framework windows services publishing to and consuming from AWS MSK

The UI is a simple standard CRUD form for each type of entity and is rigid in it's design.

Our infrastructure is manually maintained in AWS with 2 load balanced EC2 instances and the software is installed via TeamCity after environment targeted branches are merged in GitHub.

Additionally, I do a limited amount of freelance work in order to enjoy other technology stacks, keep up with current industry trends and learn about other business domains. Current technical areas of focus in this area:

- VueJS 3 w/composition API
- Azure Authentication
- VueQuery
- Tailwind
- VueUse
- Dotnet core backend
- External APIs - Keepa, Apify
- Azure DevOps

#### What do you like about it?

I've shown that I can organically lead without direct authority - I've been able to act as "the glue" between several technical and business teams, both internal and external to the company. As a contractor, this requires cultivating strong relationships and understanding the goals and motivations of each team, as well as driving alignment to the common goals. This has afforded me an opportunity to take on more responsibility and be accountable for things other than just coding - this sets me apart from the other contractors on the team. I like bridging these types of gaps when I see them and playing the role of an orchestrator among colleagues.

#### Why are you leaving your current position?

In a nutshell - I'd like to have more opportunity for ownership and take on more technical challenges. While I've been able to extend my influence beyond that of a typical contractor, I am still viewed as external to the company and, in some respects, the team. I'd like to be part of a more inclusive team where I can both mentor others and have the opportunity to increase my own learnings.

#### What do you think employers can do to better support their team members?

Listening and fostering a safe haven for personal and team based growth. Including everyone in discussions that impact the well being of the company, it's products and it's people - regardless of experience level, age or expertise in the area of discussion.

People want to know their opinion will be heard and given as much weight as anyone else's. This is paramount towards team members feeling like a valuable asset to the organization.

#### Do you prefer to be told exactly what to do, or do you prefer to work with little direction?

#### Can you rate yourself for the top 5 technologies you are most familiar with - from 1-10? 1 being not at all, and 10 being you could write an O'Reilly book on the tech.

#### Are you comfortable in all technologies and would you be willing to work across all technologies? Or, do you prefer to stay in one technology?

#### What would you say your strengths are, and your weaknesses?

#### Give us an example of when someone told you to do something that was technically wrong and/or you disagreed with the architect. How do you deal with the situation?
